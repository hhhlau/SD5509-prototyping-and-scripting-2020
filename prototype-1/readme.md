# Prototype 1

The goal for this prototype is for validating the concepts/ assumptions related to hardware, only focusing on the disconnected version

## Test plan
### The Accuracy of local weather information VS HKO data
Assumption: THe HKO data can only show marco climate but not focusing on relatively small geolocation
Expectation: The prototype 1 can provide the micro climate data which should be slightly different from the HKO one
Testing set up:

Finding:

### The compatibility of capturing user feedback 
Assumption: User would like to give feedback about the level of comfort if they are provided a chance
Expectation: The prototype 1 can capture the user feedback

### Notification/ alert about humidity (Technical focus)
Assumption: If the humidity passed a designated point, an alert should be triggered
Expectation: The prototype 1 should be show an alert if the humidity passed the designated point
